PERL scripts to automate my routine RPM packaging Functional Testing works !!

	- Reads the configs from "input.json" and selects the package and test cases to execute.
	- Some of the test case include Installation, upgrade, uninstallation, package tree structure, process start/stop/restart, modules loaded, binary file type/arch and etc.
	- debug logs are appended to "TEST_CASE.log"
	- And finally, my favorite part - Creates a rtf document automatically and writes all the test case output to it.
